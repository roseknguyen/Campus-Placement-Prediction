# Campus-Placement-Prediction

Welcome to my team's Business Analytics project! Within our team, we developed various Machine Learning Predictive Models to predict campus placement probability and salary. These models include K-means Clustering, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. Based on which, we then assess and determine the most effective analytics method.

After exploring all methods, it appears that the Random Forest Model exhibits the highest AUC and the lowest error metrics. Therefore, we conclude that the Random Forest method stands out as the most effective analytics approach for predicting students' campus placement probability based on their education background.
